# UART
"A Verilog implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) with testbench and simulation.

---

## How It Works

- The **transmitter** takes an 8-bit data word, adds start and stop bits, and sends it serially.
- The **receiver** detects the start bit, samples the incoming bits, and reconstructs the original data.
- The **testbench** demonstrates a complete transmit-receive cycle and prints the received data.
